			Bard
		</div>

		<div class="smallfortext">
			The bard has always had a weird spot in the classes of D&D. Often called, ‘the-jack-of-all-trades’, or, ‘skill-monkey’, the bard long been the swiss-army blade of Dungeons and Dragons, being able to heal, cast arcane spells, buffings, sometimes even melee, and of course, the bard is naturally capable at all skills he tries his hand at learning, though not better than those who specialize in those skills.
		</div>

		<div class="smallfortext">
			The charismatic and confident are drawn to the bard class like flies to other, more handsome flies, as the bard class is the epitome of everything they excel at. Of course, being charismatic and confident is not a requirement for playing the bard, just as being muscular and angry is not a requirement for playing the barbarian, but it doesn’t hurt, and can definitely make for more verisimilitudinous gameplay.
		</div>

		<div class="smallfortext">
			In 5th edition, many players go with the Lore bard, as many consider Magical Secrets to be one of the most versatile abilities in the entire game, and allows the bard to gain access to the fabled fireball spell, which many consider to be one of the best low-level spells, and not without reason; it is without a doubt a powerhouse.
